  #accessors, because we'll want to read and change them. Do we want to change strength ?  - Yes, in the case where strength decrease as the fighter gets tired over time

  attr_accessor :hp, :strength

  #accessor reader so we can get the player's name

  attr_reader :name
  #STATE

  # We have our 'initialize' with some parameters, strength and name

  def initialize(strength, player_name)

      @strength = strength

  # We give a default value to the life of our fighters

      @hp = 100

      @name = player_name

  end

  #BEHAVIOR

  # Getting to punch another player, who's our parameter

  def punch(player_name)
    # we change the life (hp) of our adversary, and we can because of the hp accessor !
    player_name.hp = player_name.hp - 10

  # same same but differen

  def kick(player_name)

    player_name.hp = player_name.hp - 20
